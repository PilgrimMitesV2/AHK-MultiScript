  ```

### PixelBot spamming?

- Lower `Particle Detail`
- Disable `FidelityFX Super Resolution`

### RCS inaccurate?
- Best used at **600–800 DPI**
- Set Windows mouse sensitivity to 50%
- Disable **Enhance Pointer Precision**

### GUI issues?
- Delete `Settings.ini`
- Use **Notepad++** to open `.AHK` files and set encoding to **UTF-8 BOM**
